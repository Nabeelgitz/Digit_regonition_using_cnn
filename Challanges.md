## Challenges Faced & How We Overcame Them in Improving Accuracy & Efficiency  

### Challenges Faced:  
1. **Overfitting on MNIST** – Model performed well on training data but slightly worse on test data.  
2. **Computational Inefficiency** – Training took longer due to the large dataset and multiple convolutional layers.  
3. **Limited Generalization** – The model struggled with variations in custom handwritten images.  
4. **Low Accuracy on Noisy Images** – Slight distortion in digits led to misclassification.
